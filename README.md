**iCoins Cryptocurrency**

Project Overview:
This project involves the creation of a simplified replication system for the working of a cryptocurrency named iCoins. The system demonstrates key components of a basic cryptocurrency, including a decentralized ledger, transactions, and a replication mechanism.

Features:
Blockchain Implementation (blockchain.py):

Implements a basic blockchain structure for iCoins.
Transactions are recorded in blocks, and each block is linked to the previous one through cryptographic hashes.
Simplified proof-of-work consensus mechanism.
Cryptocurrency Replication System:

Files: blockchain.py, p2p_network.py
Simulates a decentralized peer-to-peer network for communication between iCoins nodes.
Demonstrates basic transaction verification and inclusion in the blockchain.
Nodes interact to reach consensus on the state of the blockchain.
How to Run:
Execute blockchain.py to initialize the iCoins blockchain and create sample blocks.
Execute p2p_network.py to simulate a decentralized network for iCoins nodes.
Usage:
Mining:

Mining nodes solve cryptographic puzzles to add new blocks to the blockchain.
Executing mining functions in the simulation triggers block creation and consensus.
Transactions:

Simulate transactions between iCoins wallets by initiating transactions in the code.
Transactions are verified and added to the blockchain through the consensus mechanism.
